# social-harmony
Social Harmony is a social change game designed to incentivise players and Social Change Ambassadors (SCA).   It is a platform for SCA's to launch Social Change Initiatives on the Harmony One platform and uses smart contracts and inherent features of the Harmony One platform to ensure the goals and milestones of each Social Change Initiative is transparent, enforced, and managed.  Designed not just for the decentralised communities to fund meaningful and impactful initiatives, Social Harmony also has roadmap plans to incorporate requirements to support CSR initiatives for corporations looking to initiate, run and fund social change.
